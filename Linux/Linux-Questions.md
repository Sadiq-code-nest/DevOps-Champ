- How does the Internet Work?
    
    ### Simple Explanation:
    
    The internet is like a huge **network of networks**. It connects computers across the world so they can **send and receive data**.
    
    ### 🔁 How It Works (Step-by-Step):
    
    1. You type `www.google.com` in your browser.
    2. **DNS** (like a phonebook) finds the IP address for `google.com`.
    3. Your request travels through **routers and ISPs** to reach Google's server.
    4. The server processes your request and sends back the webpage.
    5. You see the result in your browser.
    
    📦 **Analogy**: Like sending a letter — you (client) send it via post (internet), and the server replies back with the info (data).
    
- What is the server?
    
    ### Simple Explanation:
    
    A **server** is a special computer that waits for requests and **responds with data or services**.
    
    ### 📌 Examples:
    
    - A **web server** sends you webpages.
    - A **file server** stores and shares files.
    - A **database server** stores data for apps and websites.
    
    📦 **Analogy**: A server is like a **chef in a restaurant** — it waits for orders (requests), cooks the food (processes), and serves it (response).
    
- Difference between the web server and the application server?
    
    
    | Feature | Web Server | Application Server |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Purpose | Serves static content (HTML, CSS) | Runs app logic and dynamic content |
    | Examples | Nginx, Apache | Tomcat, JBoss, Node.js |
    | Language Support | Basic web content | Backend logic (Java, PHP, etc.) |
- Types of applications?
    
    ### Major Types:
    
    1. **Standalone Applications** – Runs on your local machine (e.g., VLC Player, MS Word).
    2. **Web Applications** – Accessed via a browser (e.g., Gmail, Facebook).
    3. **Mobile Applications** – Installed on phones (e.g., Instagram app).
    4. **Enterprise Applications** – For business use (e.g., ERP systems like SAP).
    5. **Cloud-native Applications** – Built to run on cloud (scalable & containerized).
- What are standalone apps?
    
    Applications that **run locally on your computer** without needing the internet or a web browser.
    
     Examples:
    
    - MS Word
    - Adobe Photoshop
    - VLC Media Player
    
    📦 **Analogy**: Like using a **calculator** — it works without being connected to anything else.
    
- What are web applications?
    
    Applications that run on a **web server** and are accessed through a **browser** using the internet.
    
    Examples:
    
    - Gmail
    - Facebook
    - YouTube
    
    📦 **Analogy**: Like a **restaurant’s online menu** — you use your browser to place an order (interact with the app).
    
- What is application support?
    
    It means **monitoring, troubleshooting, and fixing issues** in running applications to keep them working smoothly.
    
    ### 🔍 Tasks in Application Support:
    
    - Respond to app errors
    - Handle user issues
    - Monitor logs and performance
    - Apply patches
    
    📦 **Analogy**: Like a **mechanic** who keeps your car (app) running smoothly and responds when it breaks down.
    
- What is application maintenance?
    
    **Continuous improvement** of an application after it’s deployed — fixing bugs, updating features, improving security.
    
    ### 🔧 Types:
    
    - Corrective: Fixing bugs
    - Adaptive: Adjusting for environment changes
    - Perfective: Improving performance
    - Preventive: Avoiding future issues
    
    📦 **Analogy**: Like **updating your mobile app** — maintenance includes bug fixes and new features.
